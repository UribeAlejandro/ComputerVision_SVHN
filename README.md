# Computer Vision - The Street View House Numbers
## Acknowledgements
This hands-on experience with Computer Vision common projects was inspired by TensorFlow 2 for Deep Learning by Dr Kevin Webster - Coursera and the concepts explained in Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow by Aureélien Géron - O'Reily.

Sections of code were taken from both sources stated above.  
All the datasets used along this notebook are open sourced.
## About the Dataset
[SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and formatting. It can be seen as similar in flavor to [MNIST](https://github.com/UribeAlejandro/ComputerVision_MNIST), but incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

Examples are shown below:
